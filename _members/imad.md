    I am a third-year PhD student at Heriot-Watt University, Malaysia campus. 
    My research interests include object detection, machine learning modelling and deployment, and drone-based visual monitoring.
    Currently, I am working on detecting defects on wind turbine blades captured from high-resolution drone images while also delving into other pertinent issues such as inconsistencies of annotations and interpretation of defects.
