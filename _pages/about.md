Hi! I am an Associate Professor at the [School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences/about.htm), [Heriot-Watt University (Malaysia Campus)](https://www.hw.ac.uk/malaysia/). I spent much of my early career at [Multimedia University](http://www.mmu.edu.my/), Malaysia where I founded the [Visual Processing (ViPr) Lab](https://viprlab.github.io/) and was also chair of the Centre for Visual Computing (CVC). From 2017-2019, I was also a Visiting Research Fellow at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) as a recepient of the Belt and Road Initiative Young Scientist Fellowship where I worked closely with [Weiyao Lin](https://weiyaolin.github.io/).

My research interests spans broadly the areas of computer vision and multimedia signal processing. In particular, my current research focus is on the understanding and analysis of emotional signals from a variety of context - from photographs to subtle facial cues to human-robot interactions. I still work on a lot of classical problems related to visual surveillance: object detection from high resolution imagery, activity recognition and localization.  

I am currently serving as the Subject Editor (Senior Area Chair) of the [Signal Processing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/signal-processing) journal, and Associate Editor of [IEEE Transactions on Multimedia](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/ieee-transactions-multimedia), [EURASIP Journal of Image and Video Processing](https://jivp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/), [The Computer Journal](https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/) and [Frontiers in Signal Processing - Image Processing](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/signal-processing). I am also a Senior Member of IEEE and an elected member of the IEEE Multimedia Systems and Applications (MSA) Technical Committee for 2020-2024 Term.
